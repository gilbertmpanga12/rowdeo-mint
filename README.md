# Rowdeo-mint ğŸ¤‘
This is the unofficial name for the project. I'm currently investigating as to whether NFTs can be used as money.

# Why? ğŸ˜«
NFTs are just JPEGs and if in theory could be used as a way to send and receive money, there would be no need
for gas fees and everything would be super cheap and instant.

# Caveats
My knowledge on how ethereum works is currently super limited ğŸ¥ºğŸ¥º, so I'm going to educate my self.
If this is a dead-end, hey why not just reach out and DM me , hey this is totally wrong.

## Some random questions for further research ğŸ”¬
* How are NFTs validated?
* Do NFTs require miners to be validated? (Turns out nope)
